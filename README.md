# AshLib
Library that comes with multiple utilities

## AshFile
An AshFile is a data structure composed of camps. Each camp has a name and a value. This value can be of different types(numbers, text...)
It also is a file format, with the extension **.ash**. It is very easy to save and load an AshFile from a file, making it a reliable and easy way to use it in programming projects and then store it
You can also use Models to ensure the camps are in a correct format

## DeltaHelper
This little utility will make it easy to calculate fps and deltaTime. You just need to call a method once a frame

##TimeTool
Utility that helps you debug time related stuff(for example, the percentage operations are taking each frame)

##TreeLog
Utility that will help you produce a Collapsible and idented log for making debugging easier. There is a notepad++ custom language in [here](./n++)

##FormatString
A formatted string, for displaying colored(and more options!) text in the console

## Dependencies
This utility helps you handle files in a project, using a folder similar to the .minecraft folder

## Dates
This is a struct that represents a time, down to seconds, between the years 1488 and 2511.
Its main attraction is you can convert this Date int just 6 base64 printable chars. This is called s CPTF(Compressed printable date format)
